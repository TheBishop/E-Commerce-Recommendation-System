# E-Commerce Recommendation System

## Overview

This repository contains a Python-based E-Commerce Recommendation System implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The project demonstrates how to build a recommendation engine for e-commerce platforms, capable of suggesting products to users based on past interactions and product features.

## Features

* Data preprocessing and cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Implementation of recommendation algorithms

  * Collaborative Filtering
  * Content-Based Filtering
* Evaluation of recommendations
* Visualization of results

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Libraries:

  * pandas
  * numpy
